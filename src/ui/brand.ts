// Single source of truth for the app's name + tagline. The React UI and the
// web build (vite.config.ts → HTML <title> + PWA manifest) both read from here,
// so renaming the app is a one-line change in this file.
//
// A few native/release files can't import TypeScript and must be edited
// alongside this file for a full rename — see docs/08-branding.md for the list
// and the icon-regeneration process.

// Fan-project disclaimer shown in the footer (web + desktop). Built from
// APP_NAME so it follows any rename. Pokémon UNITE is published by The Pokémon
// Company (developed by TiMi Studio Group); the Pokémon marks are Nintendo's.
